"""Retired single-file migration entrypoint.

Only the canonical full-chain runners may mutate schema:

    make migrate

Executing one SQL file bypasses ordered discovery, the canonical ledger,
schema ownership, and restore-required checks, so this module always fails
closed before reading a DSN or opening a database connection.

-- AI Gateway role bootstrap (PRD ARC-03 §3D)
-- ============================================================================
-- ADMIN-ONLY: creates the platform's NOLOGIN object owner and LOGIN process
-- roles.  Idempotent by design; run by a one-time PostgreSQL admin (local
-- Compose) or pre-created by a DBA (managed PostgreSQL, receipt without
-- secrets).  ai_gateway_migrator cannot execute this file: it intentionally
-- has no ALTER ROLE / CREATE ROLE authority and only verifies the result.
--
-- Hard rules encoded here:
--   * ai_gateway_migrator is the only DDL executor and NEVER has CREATEROLE
--     or cluster-admin rights; it can SET ROLE into the NOLOGIN owner.
--   * Application roles get no CREATE rights and no broad PUBLIC grants.
--   * Role-level search_path starts with pg_catalog and ends with public.
--   * Passwords are never part of this file; credential generation is a
--     runtime input (scripts/new/init-env.sh / managed DBA), not repo state.
--
-- The canonical prefix is ``ai_gateway_``.  Managed deployments may
-- namespace roles through AI_GATEWAY_ROLE_PREFIX; the authority renders
-- this file with the configured prefix before executing it.

-- gives that NOLOGIN identity CREATE without granting CREATE to any process
-- LOGIN role.  On an existing database this is the first, transactional step
-- of convergence; cutover_convergence.sql repeats and verifies the full set.

-- 6. Safe defaults for baseline and future epoch objects ---------------------
-- PostgreSQL grants PUBLIC EXECUTE on new routines and PUBLIC USAGE on new
-- types unless the creating role overrides those defaults.  Baseline DDL runs
-- as ai_gateway_owner, so freeze the four schemas before any object exists.
-- The built-in grants are global defaults; schema-specific REVOKE cannot
-- subtract them. Revoke globally first, then retain explicit per-schema rows
-- so the fingerprint proves the intended scope.

"""Shim identity tests for the ARC-04 first batch.

PRD §ARC-04 goal 5: every moved protocol keeps a thin compatibility shim in
``ai_gateway_core`` until all consumers migrate.  These tests lock that the
shims re-export the *same objects* (not copies) and the full public surface,
so code mixing import paths keeps working (isinstance checks, dataclass
equality, pydantic registry lookups).

Delete this file together with the shims once consumers import
``ai_gateway_contracts`` directly (see each shim's removal conditions).

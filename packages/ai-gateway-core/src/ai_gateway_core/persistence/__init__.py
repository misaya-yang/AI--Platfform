"""Database-storage contract + shared concrete implementation.

Both services need a handle to persistent storage. The concrete asyncpg-
backed ``DatabaseStorage`` was historically per-service (``src/persistence/
database.py`` in gateway, copied into the AS container via ``COPY src/``).
Phase 5f Batch C moved the concrete here so the AS image no longer needs
the gateway's ``src/`` on PYTHONPATH for DB access.

- ``DatabaseStorageLike`` — minimal Protocol for type hints in callers.
- ``DatabaseStorage`` — full asyncpg-backed concrete (~7K LOC).

"""Shared pure-utility helpers for knowledge-base callers.

These live in ``ai_gateway_core`` so the gateway can ask "is this model
multimodal?" without reaching into ``src.services.knowledge.embedding``
or making an HTTP call to the kb-service for a static lookup.

The kb-service's ``services/knowledge/embedding.py`` re-exports the same
symbols for backward compatibility.

Promoted as part of Phase K5b (KB fork merge → kb-service single source).

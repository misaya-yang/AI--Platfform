"""``EventBus`` — async publisher for the Redis Streams event bus.

Responsibilities (and *only* these):

- Maintain a single lazy ``redis.asyncio.Redis`` connection.
- Resolve the destination stream key from the envelope's ``event_type``.
- ``XADD`` the envelope as a single JSON blob in the field
  ``"payload"`` with an approximate ``MAXLEN ~ {trim_max_len}``
  (``~`` = approximate trim, lets Redis pick efficient trim points).
- Return the auto-generated stream id so the caller can correlate.

Things this module deliberately does NOT do:

- No retries / backoff — that belongs in the calling code or a higher
  layer. Redis is fast enough that a transient blip is the user's
  problem to handle.
- No batching — single-event publish keeps the contract simple.
  Aggregation happens upstream (the usage recorder already buffers).
- No serialization fallbacks — anything that isn't a valid
  ``EventEnvelope`` is a programming bug, not a bus concern.

Wire format:

    XADD <stream> MAXLEN ~ <N> *  payload "<envelope-json>"

The single-field "payload" form keeps decoder code trivial: read the
``payload`` field bytes, ``parse_envelope`` it, done.

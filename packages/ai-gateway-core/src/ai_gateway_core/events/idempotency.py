"""``IdempotencyStore`` — per-consumer dedupe of ``event_id``.

Why this exists: Redis Streams give *at-least-once* delivery. A
consumer crash between "handler returned" and "XACK" replays the
same message after restart. Most handlers are idempotent in spirit
but not in implementation (e.g. inserting a row, charging a credit
counter), so we put a small lookaside in front of the handler.

Algorithm: ``SET key NX EX ttl`` where the key is
``{prefix}:{consumer}:{event_id}``.

- If the SET succeeds (NX), this is the first time we've seen the
  ``event_id`` *for this consumer* — return ``True``, run the handler.
- If the SET fails, another worker (or a previous incarnation of this
  worker) already claimed it — return ``False``, the consumer skips
  the handler call but still ACKs.

Per-consumer scoping (``{consumer}`` in the key) is important: the
same event may legitimately be processed by multiple consumer groups
(billing aggregator AND observability), and each must see it exactly
once *for itself*.

TTL: events older than ``ttl_seconds`` (default 24 h) are unlikely to
replay because Redis will have trimmed them from the stream by then.
A short TTL keeps the lookaside table from growing without bound.

        redis
            Async Redis client. The store does **not** own this client —
            the caller (typically ``EventConsumer``) is responsible for
            its lifetime. This avoids double-close in setups where the

        ttl_seconds
            Expiration window. Should comfortably exceed the longest
            stream retention so a true replay still hits the cache.

"""Metrics contract.

Both services record usage and realtime metrics. The concrete recorders
(Prometheus/Redis/DB-backed) live per-service; assistant code talks to
them via these lightweight Protocols.

NoOp reference impls are provided so an un-injected AssistantService
degrades to silent no-op recording instead of NoneType-crashing.

"""Generic SSE heartbeat wrapper for streaming pass-through proxies.

Long upstream tool calls (Gemini image gen 60s+, KB queries 30s+, model
generation under contention) leave the SSE stream silent for stretches
that exceed nginx's default proxy_read_timeout, ALB idle timeout, mobile
NAT keepalive windows. The browser-side EventSource then fires
``ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`` mid-flight and the model's final response never
reaches the user.

The fix is a constant ``: heartbeat\\n\\n`` SSE comment line every N
seconds of producer silence — invisible to spec-compliant EventSource
consumers (lines starting with ``:`` are dropped per the SSE spec) but
keeps every TCP/HTTP intermediary's keepalive timer alive.

The same pattern lives directly inside
``apps/assistant-service/.../routes/chat.py`` for the AS-owned event
generator. This module is the **proxy-layer** version: it wraps an
``async generator`` of bytes (or strings) coming back from a pass-
through ``client.stream(...)`` so the gateway's SSE proxies for agent-
agent and other LangGraph upstreams get the same protection without
having to edit each upstream's code.

Usage::

    async def upstream_gen():
        async with client.stream(...) as resp:
            async for chunk in resp.aiter_raw():
                yield chunk

    return StreamingResponse(
        with_sse_heartbeat(upstream_gen(), interval_seconds=15.0),
        media_type="text/event-stream",
    )

    The wrapped iterator yields:
      * Each item the upstream produces, exactly as produced.
      * A heartbeat frame every ``interval_seconds`` of producer silence.
        The frame type is bytes by default (proxy ``aiter_raw`` is the
        common caller). Pass ``as_str=True`` if your producer yields
        ``str`` chunks so heartbeats match — mixing types would corrupt
        the stream when StreamingResponse encodes.

    Cancellation: when the consumer disconnects or stops iterating, the
    producer task is cancelled cleanly. Exceptions raised inside the
    upstream propagate to the consumer.

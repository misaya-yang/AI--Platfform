# Phase 01 - AI Assistant Trace Schema and API

> Enter plan-first mode before editing. Execute this phase only, work on ATE-F002 only, and do not implement assistant-service capture or frontend UI in this phase.

**Goal:** Add the AI Assistant trace database contract and tenant-scoped Eval API surface.

**Architecture:** This phase creates the durable storage and API read/write contract for AI Assistant trace evaluation. It must expose trace list, trace detail, and score write semantics without changing assistant-service runtime behavior. LangGraph Proxy Trace and RAG Trace fields may be represented through typed `trace_family` and metadata contracts, but only AI Assistant data is accepted in this phase.

**Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL additive migration, FastAPI router under `src/api/v1`, Pydantic schemas under `src/api/schemas`, ai-gateway-core persistence helpers, pytest API tests, OpenAPI compatibility tests, and ruff.

- GOAL_PROMPT: Complete ATE-01 AI Assistant Trace Schema and API for `.` by following `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/phase-01-ai-assistant-trace-schema-and-api.md`; work on feature-oracle item ATE-F002; depend on ATE-00 evidence; add only the AI Assistant trace schema and tenant-scoped Eval API contract; do not implement assistant-service trace capture or frontend UI; stay inside named edit boundaries; make the smallest requirement-satisfying change; finish only after validation, regression, compliance, rollback, evidence, minimal-change, critic, and acceptance gates pass or blockers are documented.

- DO_NOT_EDIT: `apps/assistant-service/`, `web/`, `src/api/v1/langgraph.py`, production systems, secret files, deployment configuration
- EXECUTION_MODE: plan-first; implement one phase and one feature item; verify before completion; write evidence before handoff
- VALIDATION_COMMANDS: `uv run ruff check src/api/v1/eval.py src/api/schemas/eval.py packages/ai-gateway-core/src/ai_gateway_core/persistence/repositories/agent_trace_repository.py tests/api/test_eval_traces.py tests/contract/test_openapi_schema_compat.py`; `uv run --extra dev --extra test pytest -q --no-cov tests/api/test_eval_traces.py tests/api/test_gateway_tenant_isolation.py tests/contract/test_openapi_schema_compat.py`; `rg -n 'agent_traces|agent_trace_spans|agent_trace_events|agent_trace_scores|tenant_id|trace_family|assistant' database/migrations/060_agent_trace_eval.sql`; `python3 /Users/misaya.yanghejazfs.com.au/.codex/skills/prd-phase-harness/scripts/validate_harness_prd.py deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd --strict --quality-score`

- REGRESSION_SCOPE: Existing usage trace API behavior remains unchanged; assistant session and OpenAPI compatibility tests remain passing; ATE-00 facts remain valid.
- COMPLIANCE_GATES: Authenticated tenant context is required; trace queries filter by server-side tenant_id; redacted and bounded payloads only; no production migration.
- ROLLBACK_PLAN: Revert migration and API files before application, or run a reviewed local rollback migration that drops only ATE-01 trace tables in dependency order.
- ACCEPTANCE_GATES: Migration, Eval API, tests, source-packet writeback, continuity ledger update, minimal-change scope, and independent critic verdict are complete.
- EVIDENCE_OUTPUT: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-01-ai-assistant-trace-schema-and-api-report.md`
- STOP_CONDITIONS: Stop if ATE-00 is not passed, tenant isolation cannot be enforced, destructive migration is required, assistant-service changes are required, or OpenAPI compatibility fails without an approved update.

## Task Spec

Implement the storage and API foundation for AI Assistant traces. The API must let the Eval console list traces, inspect one trace with spans and events, and attach evaluator scores. It must not yet capture assistant-service runtime events.

## Problem Boundary

In scope: additive schema, repository helper, Pydantic schemas, FastAPI Eval routes, router registration, API tests, OpenAPI contract update when required, and harness evidence.

Out of scope: assistant-service writes, frontend pages, LangGraph Proxy trace capture, RAG retrieval trace capture, production migration execution, external observability exports.

## Context Policy

Load only the four `PRIMARY_CONTEXT` paths after `READ_FIRST`. Open ATE-00 reports and ledger rows only to confirm dependency acceptance. Defer source packet, continuity ledger, feature oracle, and progress log until targeted writeback.

## Requirements

- Add tables for root traces, spans, events, and scores with server-side tenant ownership.
- Model `trace_family` with first-wave value `assistant`; future values must not appear in AI Assistant endpoint results.
- Store run identifiers, session identifiers, request identifiers, timing, status, model/provider metadata, redaction flags, and bounded JSON payload summaries.
- Provide Eval API endpoints for list, detail, and score write.
- Preserve existing usage trace endpoints and assistant session APIs.

## Test and Regression Requirements

Run the validation commands from the Machine Contract. API tests must prove same-tenant access succeeds, cross-tenant access is rejected, score writes use evaluator identity from auth context, and OpenAPI remains compatible.

## Compliance and Safety Requirements

Do not store raw secrets, tokens, provider keys, or connection strings in trace payloads. Do not execute migrations against production. Do not accept tenant_id from the request body or query string as an authorization source.

## Rollback and Recovery

Rollback removes only the ATE-01 Eval API files and additive trace tables. If a local development database has applied the migration, rollback must drop score, event, span, then root trace tables in dependency order.

## Execution Capture

Write `reports/ate-01-ai-assistant-trace-schema-and-api-report.md` with Status, Validation Evidence, Feature Oracle Updates, Minimal Change, Regression Scope, Compliance Evidence, Rollback Evidence, and Next Phase Handoff. Update source packet, continuity ledger, progress log, feature oracle, handoff, and loop state.

## Critic Protocol

Use `reports/ate-01-ai-assistant-trace-schema-and-api-critic.md`. The critic must state `Critic Verdict`, name the actor report reviewed, and verify tenant isolation, redaction, additive migration design, rollback path, OpenAPI compatibility, test sufficiency, and minimal-change scope.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Eval API list, detail, and score endpoints are tenant-scoped.
- Migration introduces only additive AI Assistant trace tables and indexes.
- Tests cover positive, cross-tenant negative, and score write paths.
- ATE-02 receives a stable trace-write contract without requiring schema redesign.

## Risks

- Cross-tenant leakage is the highest risk because traces contain conversation and tool metadata.
- Raw prompt or tool payload storage can create open-source and compliance exposure.
- Schema overreach can prematurely couple LangGraph Proxy and RAG Trace to AI Assistant implementation.

# Phase 00 - Baseline Trace Architecture

> Enter plan-first mode before editing. Execute this phase only, work on ATE-F001 only, and do not advance to ATE-01 until the report and critic artifact pass the gates below.

**Goal:** Freeze repo-specific trace architecture, first-wave scope, and validation boundaries before implementation.

**Architecture:** The Agent Trace Eval module follows the industry pattern found in LangSmith, Langfuse, Phoenix, MLflow, and OpenTelemetry GenAI: a root trace/run contains ordered spans, durable events, tenant-scoped metadata, and score or feedback records. First-wave implementation covers AI Assistant traces only. LangGraph Proxy Trace and RAG Trace stay as documented expansion contracts until ATE-04 hands them off.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI backend, assistant-service agent loop, PostgreSQL migrations, React/Vite frontend, pytest, ruff, pnpm lint, pnpm type check, and Playwright-backed e2e smoke.

- DO_NOT_EDIT: `src/`, `apps/`, `packages/`, `database/`, `web/`, production systems, secret files, deployment configuration

- BROWSER_CHECKS: No browser route is created in ATE-00; any browser-visible edit blocks completion until route and viewport evidence are recorded.

- COMPLIANCE_GATES: Do not read or write secrets, mutate production data, deploy, run production migrations, or configure external services.
- ROLLBACK_PLAN: Revert ATE-00 runbook file updates and leave runtime code untouched if validation fails.
- ACCEPTANCE_GATES: Actor report exists; validation evidence is recorded; ATE-F001, progress log, handoff, source packet, and continuity ledger are updated; minimal-change scope and independent critic verdict are recorded.
- EVIDENCE_OUTPUT: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-00-baseline-trace-architecture-report.md`
- STOP_CONDITIONS: Stop if AI Assistant scope cannot be separated, public documentation evidence is insufficient, docs ignore proof contradicts persistence choice, or strict validation fails after one repair pass.

## Task Spec

Create the durable planning baseline for the Agent Trace Eval module. The first implementation wave is AI Assistant trace and eval only. Future LangGraph Proxy Trace and RAG Trace work must remain visible through contracts, not implementation changes.

## Problem Boundary

In scope: trace architecture, data model plan, API surface plan, UI route plan, validation plan, risk gates, and handoff files under the harness directory.

Out of scope: database migrations, FastAPI routes, assistant-service trace writers, frontend components, deployments, production data access, external observability platform integration.

## Context Policy

Load `READ_FIRST` first. Load each `PRIMARY_CONTEXT` item only to verify current repo facts before writing the actor report. Defer `source-packet.md`, `continuity-ledger.md`, `feature-oracle.json`, and `progress-log.md` until targeted lookup or writeback is needed.

## Requirements

- Record the root trace/run, span, event, and score data model as the shared contract.
- Record the first-wave API endpoints for AI Assistant trace list, detail, and score write.
- Record `/eval` as the future frontend module with Assistant, LangGraph Proxy, and RAG tabs.
- Record LangGraph Proxy and RAG Trace as future slices blocked from ATE-01 through ATE-03 implementation.
- Record security gates for tenant isolation, redaction, and no secret capture.

## Test and Regression Requirements

Run the four validation commands from the Machine Contract. Record exact exit status and key output in the actor report. If the placeholder scan exits 1 because no matches exist, record that exit as the expected pass.

## Compliance and Safety Requirements

Do not read secret files, print environment secrets, access production data, run migrations, deploy, or configure external services.

## Rollback and Recovery

If ATE-00 fails, revert only harness file changes from this phase, keep runtime code untouched, set loop-state status to `blocked`, and write the blocker into the actor report.

## Execution Capture

Write `reports/ate-00-baseline-trace-architecture-report.md` with Status, Validation Evidence, Feature Oracle Updates, Minimal Change, Regression Scope, Compliance Evidence, and Next Phase Handoff. Update source packet, continuity ledger, progress log, feature oracle, handoff, and loop state.

## Critic Protocol

Use a separate critic artifact at `reports/ate-00-baseline-trace-architecture-critic.md`. The critic must state `Critic Verdict`, name the actor report reviewed, and verify scope, validation evidence, redaction and tenant-isolation gates, minimal-change evidence, and ATE-01 readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Strict harness validation passes.
- ATE-F001 has actor and critic evidence paths.
- LangGraph Proxy Trace and RAG Trace are documented but not implemented.
- ATE-01 has exact primary context, edit paths, validation commands, and rollback gates.

## Risks

- If baseline planning mixes all three trace families into the first wave, ATE-01 will be too broad.
- If docs persistence is not proven, this runbook can be lost because root `docs/` is ignored.
- If tenant isolation and redaction gates are vague, later code can store sensitive cross-tenant trace content.

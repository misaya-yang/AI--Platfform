# Agent Trace Eval PRD Harness Source Packet

**Date:** 2026-06-26

**Prepared For:** `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd`

---

## Request Summary

Create a detailed next-stage PRD plan for complete agent trace and Eval capabilities. The product surface is a new frontend Eval module with three planned functions:

1. Agent eval for AI assistant conversation traces.
2. Trace visibility for all LangGraph CLI or LangGraph Server agents that are transparently forwarded through the gateway.
3. RAG trace visibility for assistant-service and knowledge-service retrieval paths, including retrieval chains and greeting or conversational chains.

The first implementation wave must cover AI assistant only and must coordinate frontend, backend, and database work. Trace recording must not add user-visible agent latency; trace persistence is a best-effort side channel, not part of the chat critical path.

## Product Thesis

The platform needs a first-party agent trace and Eval layer that sits above raw logs and OTel spans. It should let product, engineering, and operators inspect what an agent did, why it did it, how much it cost, where failures happened, and whether quality improved after code or prompt changes. The first version must be self-hostable and should not require LangSmith, Langfuse, Phoenix, or MLflow accounts.

## Industry Research Synthesis

- LangSmith treats a trace as the execution path from input to output; individual steps are runs. Its evaluation model separates offline dataset evaluation from online production run/thread evaluation.
- Langfuse uses traces and observations as the primary debug unit, then attaches scores, annotations, datasets, and experiments so production traces can become regression test cases.
- Phoenix uses OpenTelemetry/OpenInference instrumentation, groups traces by project/session, and evaluates traces or spans with LLM-based, code-based, or human labels.
- MLflow emphasizes OTel compatibility and trace-aware scoring where evaluators can read spans, attributes, outputs, tool trajectories, sub-agent routing, and retrieved document recall.
- OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions provide the field vocabulary we should align to: agent id/name/version, conversation id, input/output messages, model request/response fields, token usage, retrieval documents/query, tool call id/arguments/result, and evaluation score/value/label.

Design implication: implement a vendor-neutral internal data model with source-specific adapters. Do not lock the first wave to one SaaS trace backend.

## Current System Facts

- Gateway routes are registered in `src/api/router.py`. Assistant route is `src/api/v1/assistant.py`; LangGraph proxy route is `src/api/v1/langgraph.py`; usage trace API is `src/api/v1/usage.py`; dashboard route is `src/api/v1/dashboard.py`.
- Assistant service chat entrypoints are `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/api/routes/chat.py` and `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/assistant_service.py`.
- The streaming-first agent loop is `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/agent/agent_loop.py`. It creates `AgentLoopContext.run_id`, emits `run_started`, emits terminal `run_finished` or `run_error`, and persists context detail into `assistant_context_breakdown`.
- Assistant run state already exists through migration `database/migrations/034_assistant_gateway_foundation.sql` with `assistant_runs`, `assistant_command_queue`, and `assistant_tool_approvals`.
- Context detail metrics exist through `database/migrations/039_assistant_context_metrics.sql` with `assistant_context_breakdown`.
- Request-level sampled traces exist through `database/migrations/033_observability_and_quota_governance.sql` with `request_traces`, `trace_steps`, latency fields, tokens, and sample reason.
- Base conversation storage is the `sessions` table in `database/schema.sql`; session history is stored as JSONB and is accessed through `packages/ai-gateway-core/src/ai_gateway_core/persistence/database.py`.
- OTel inbound and traceparent propagation already exist in `packages/ai-gateway-core/src/ai_gateway_core/tracing/`, and service startup initializes tracing in gateway, assistant-service, and knowledge-service.
- Frontend route registration is `web/src/router.tsx`; navigation is `web/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx`; assistant UI is `web/src/pages/assistant/`; existing dashboard trace UI is `web/src/pages/dashboard/components/panels/RequestTracePanel.tsx`.
- Frontend assistant stream telemetry in `web/src/features/chat/telemetry.ts` currently emits browser events and optional beacon payloads, but it is not the durable server-side trace store.
- Project validation commands are available from `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `web/package.json`, and existing tests under `tests/`, `web/e2e/`, and `tests/tracing/`.

## Target Data Model

First-wave tables should be additive and tenant-scoped. Suggested names are descriptive; implementation can adjust after baseline review if the contract is preserved.

- `agent_traces`: root trace record with `trace_id`, `trace_family` (historical docs may call this `source_kind`), `workflow_kind`, `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `session_id`, `thread_id`, `run_id`, `request_id`, `otel_trace_id`, `traceparent`, `model_id`, `provider`, `status`, timing, token usage, cost, redacted input/output preview, metadata, metrics, privacy, retention fields, and timestamps.
- `agent_trace_spans`: nested steps with `span_id`, `trace_id`, `parent_span_id`, `span_kind`, `name`, `status`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, duration, redacted input/output preview, attributes, and error fields.
- `agent_trace_events`: ordered lifecycle events with `event_id`, `trace_id`, optional `span_id`, `event_type`, sequence, timestamp, redacted payload, and size metadata.
- `agent_trace_scores`: human or evaluator feedback with `score_id`, `trace_id`, optional `span_id`, `score_name`, numeric/categorical/boolean/text value, label, explanation, scorer type, evaluator version, created_by, and timestamps.

Trace taxonomy:

- `trace_family`: `assistant`, `langgraph_proxy`, `rag`. `source_kind` is a historical planning alias only.
- `workflow_kind`: `ai_assistant_chat`, `langgraph_agent_run`, `rag_retrieval_chain`, `rag_greeting_chain`.
- `span_kind`: `lifecycle`, `model_call`, `tool_call`, `retrieval`, `rerank`, `context_build`, `memory`, `subagent`, `gateway_proxy`, `score`, `error`.

Privacy default: store summaries, ids, metrics, statuses, and previews. Full raw prompts, raw retrieved chunks, tool arguments, and outputs must be redacted, truncated, or disabled unless a future approved retention setting is added.

Performance default: trace recording must run outside the agent response critical path. The implementation should use an in-process bounded queue, background task, outbox writer, or equivalent non-blocking pattern with short timeouts and deterministic drop behavior under pressure. A slow or failing trace writer must not delay first token, stream event ordering, non-stream final response, or assistant run status updates. ATE-02 must include regression evidence for slow persistence and persistence failure paths.

## API Contract

First-wave backend API should be explicit and small:

- `GET /api/v1/eval/traces`: list tenant-scoped traces with filters for source kind, workflow kind, status, model, user, session, run id, date range, score status, and text search over redacted previews.
- `GET /api/v1/eval/traces/{trace_id}`: return root trace, spans, events, scores, linked session/run/request ids, and redacted payload previews.
- `POST /api/v1/eval/traces/{trace_id}/scores`: add manual score or evaluator score using a bounded schema.
- `GET /api/v1/eval/summary`: optional aggregate counts for first-wave cards if ATE-03 needs compact KPIs.

All endpoints must enforce auth, tenant isolation, and permission checks. ATE-01 should decide whether to add `eval:trace:view` and `eval:trace:score` permissions, or to temporarily reuse `console:dashboard:view` with a documented migration follow-up. Because trace data can contain sensitive user content, dedicated permissions are preferred.

## Frontend Information Architecture

Add a protected `/eval` module to the authenticated app shell.

First-wave UI:

- Eval nav item with an icon from `lucide-react`.
- Tabs: Assistant, LangGraph Proxy, RAG.
- Assistant tab active in phase 1 with trace list, filters, status chips, latency/token metrics, trace detail timeline, payload metadata pane, linked session/run ids, and score panel.
- LangGraph Proxy and RAG tabs may render guarded empty states that do not promise completed functionality.
- UI should reuse existing dashboard density and table/timeline patterns, not a landing page.

## LangGraph Proxy Trace Roadmap

Later phases should instrument `src/api/v1/langgraph.py` and transparent proxy code paths so every forwarded LangGraph CLI/Server request can be correlated by tenant, user, assistant id, thread id, run id, route, upstream status, streaming terminal event, traceparent, and error. This must not forward user secrets or upstream auth headers into trace payloads.

## RAG Trace Roadmap

Later phases should add trace adapters for assistant-service and knowledge-service retrieval flows:

- Retrieval chain: query intent, dataset selection, top-k, score threshold, vector/keyword/hybrid mode, rerank, returned documents, citation use, answer grounding, latency, and errors.
- Greeting or conversational chain: query classified as greeting or conversational, KB skip decision, prompt path, no-retrieval evidence, model response, and safety checks.

The RAG roadmap inherits the same `agent_traces`, `agent_trace_spans`, `agent_trace_events`, and `agent_trace_scores` contracts.

## Validation Commands

Baseline and implementation phases should use targeted subsets of:

```bash
bash -n scripts/new/validate-env.sh
make validate-example-config
uv run ruff check src/api/v1 apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service packages/ai-gateway-core/src/ai_gateway_core tests
uv run --extra dev --extra test pytest -q --no-cov tests/api tests/services/assistant tests/tracing tests/contract
pnpm -C web lint
pnpm -C web type-check
pnpm -C web e2e:opensource
python3 /Users/misaya.yanghejazfs.com.au/.codex/skills/prd-phase-harness/scripts/validate_harness_prd.py deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd --strict --quality-score
```

ATE-01 through ATE-04 define narrower commands in their phase contracts.

## ATE-00 Baseline Execution Evidence

- Status: passed on 2026-06-26.
- Actor report: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-00-baseline-trace-architecture-report.md`.
- Critic artifact: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-00-baseline-trace-architecture-critic.md`.
- Strict validator evidence: `Harness validation passed`; `Quality score: 100 (excellent)`.
- Docs persistence evidence: root `docs/` paths match `.gitignore:81:docs/*`, so the durable PRD harness remains under `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/`.
- Confirmed first-wave boundary: ATE-01 through ATE-03 implement AI Assistant trace Eval only; LangGraph Proxy Trace and RAG Trace remain documented expansion contracts until ATE-04 handoff.
- Confirmed runtime baseline: gateway assistant routes proxy chat traffic to assistant-service, agent loop has `run_id` and `request_id` lifecycle events, and frontend router has no `/eval` route before ATE-03.

## ATE-01 Schema and API Execution Evidence

- Status: passed on 2026-06-26.
- Actor report: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-01-ai-assistant-trace-schema-and-api-report.md`.
- Critic artifact: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-01-ai-assistant-trace-schema-and-api-critic.md`.
- Migration: `database/migrations/060_agent_trace_eval.sql`.
- Tables: `agent_traces`, `agent_trace_spans`, `agent_trace_events`, `agent_trace_scores`.
- API route file: `src/api/v1/eval.py`.
- API schemas: `src/api/schemas/eval.py`.
- Repository helper: `packages/ai-gateway-core/src/ai_gateway_core/persistence/repositories/agent_trace_repository.py`.
- Registered routes: `GET /api/v1/eval/traces`, `GET /api/v1/eval/traces/{trace_id}`, `POST /api/v1/eval/traces/{trace_id}/scores`.
- Permission decision: temporary reuse of `GatewayUsageRead` / `console:usage:view`; dedicated Eval trace permissions remain a future permission hardening item.
- Validation: ruff passed, targeted pytest passed with 14 tests, migration contract scan passed, strict harness validator passed with quality score 100, and `git diff --check` passed.
- ATE-02 input contract: assistant-service can write root traces, spans, events, and scores through the ATE-01 schema/API contract, but the writer must be non-blocking for the assistant response path.

## ATE-02 Assistant Trace Capture Execution Evidence

- Status: passed on 2026-06-26.
- Actor report: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-02-assistant-trace-capture-report.md`.
- Critic artifact: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-02-assistant-trace-capture-critic.md`.
- Trace writer: `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/trace_writer.py`.
- Writer interface: `AssistantTraceWriter.start_trace`, `record_event`, `record_span`, `finish_trace`, and `drain`.
- Non-blocking policy: writer public methods submit bounded background tasks only; database IO, redaction, payload shaping, timeout handling, and failure logging happen off the chat response path.
- Backpressure policy: `max_pending` bounds in-process writes, `write_timeout_s` bounds each task, and dropped/timed-out/failed counters are recorded in trace metadata.
- Non-stream capture: `AssistantService.chat()` creates one run UUID per request, returns it in the existing `run_id` field, and submits root trace, `run_started`, context/model/finalization spans, terminal event, usage, and status.
- Streaming capture: `AgentLoop.execute()` submits trace start, gateway/run lifecycle events, all streaming-first events, terminal event, and final trace status.
- Run status ordering: `ExecutionGateway.finish_run()` remains awaited before `AgentLoop` submits `finish_trace`, so assistant run status writes do not wait for trace persistence.
- Event-to-span mapping: lifecycle events map to `lifecycle`; `context_budget` maps to `context_building`; `streaming_first_started/completed` map to `model_invocation`; `tool_call_started/completed/cancelled` map to `tool_execution`; `error` maps to `error`.
- Redaction: bearer tokens, token/password/secret keys, connection strings, sensitive dict keys, and oversized payloads are redacted or bounded before persistence.
- Validation: ruff passed; ATE-02 pytest passed with `20 passed, 2 skipped`; latency guard passed with `4 passed`; trace token scan passed; ATE-01 Eval API compatibility passed with `6 passed`; `git diff --check` passed.
- ATE-03 input contract: Eval UI can read assistant trace roots, ordered events, spans, status, run/session/request ids, timing, usage, and redacted previews through the ATE-01 API.

## ATE-03 Eval Console UI Execution Evidence

- Status: passed on 2026-06-26.
- Actor report: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-03-eval-console-ui-report.md`.
- Critic artifact: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-03-eval-console-ui-critic.md`.
- Frontend route: protected `/eval` route in `web/src/router.tsx`.
- Navigation: Eval app-shell item in `web/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx`, using the existing `console:usage:view` permission gate.
- API client: `web/src/api/eval.ts` calls assistant-only list/detail/score endpoints and does not accept browser-supplied `tenant_id`.
- UI components: `AssistantTraceList`, `AssistantTraceDetail`, and `TraceScorePanel` render trace filters, list selection, redacted detail timeline, metadata, ordered events, existing scores, and bounded score submission.
- Future tabs: LangGraph Proxy and RAG tabs are visible but guarded and contain no completed placeholder trace data.
- Latency requirement: Eval page copy states trace persistence is an async side channel and assistant latency stays on the agent path; no frontend behavior adds trace writes to the chat critical path.
- Browser evidence: `web/.playwright/eval-desktop.png` and `web/.playwright/eval-mobile.png`.
- Validation: web lint passed from `web/` with 0 errors; web type-check passed; `e2e:opensource` passed with `4 passed`; Eval API regression passed with `6 passed`.
- Command deviation: root `pnpm -C web ...` resolves to pnpm 11.x in this Codex runtime and fails before scripts run; equivalent project-version commands from `web/` use `pnpm@10.33.0` and passed without lockfile changes.
- ATE-04 input contract: whole-demand regression can verify ATE-F001 through ATE-F004 together; LangGraph Proxy and RAG remain next-wave trace families.

## ATE-04 Release Regression and Handoff Evidence

- Status: passed on 2026-06-26.
- Actor report: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-04-release-regression-and-handoff-report.md`.
- Critic artifact: `deploy/runbooks/agent-trace-eval-prd/reports/ate-04-release-regression-and-handoff-critic.md`.
- Whole-demand pytest: passed with `33 passed, 2 skipped, 13 warnings` after post-review trace hardening.
- Frontend validation: lint passed with 0 errors; type-check passed; e2e passed with `4 passed`.
- Open-source config validation: `make validate-example-config` passed.
- Broad backend ruff gate: passed with `All checks passed!` after lint-baseline remediation.
- Lint remediation: safe/unsafe ruff mechanical fixes, narrow interface noqa markers, Python 3.10 syntax fixes, optional dependency probe cleanup, and re-export metadata cleanup across assistant-service.
- Harness completion gate: strict validation, ATE-04 completion gate, and full-demand completion gate all passed with quality score 100.
- ATE-F005 decision: passing; first-wave AI Assistant trace Eval is ready for handoff. Terminal loop-state remains `active_phase=ATE-04`, `active_feature=ATE-F005`, `status=verified` for validator compatibility.
- Post-review hardening added regression coverage for pre-model failed terminal traces, terminal span status monotonicity under out-of-order background writes, concurrent multi-user trace isolation, and same-session multi-turn distinct run ids.

## LangGraph Proxy Trace Expansion Contract

- Use existing ATE-01 tables with `trace_family=langgraph_proxy` and `workflow_kind=langgraph_agent_run`.
- Capture tenant/user/request ids, upstream route, HTTP method, upstream status, LangGraph thread/run ids when available, traceparent, otel trace id, latency, terminal status, and bounded error summary.
- Model spans/events around transparent proxy receive, upstream request, streaming lifecycle, terminal event, retry/backoff if added later, timeout, cancellation, and error.
- Never persist upstream auth headers, cookies, API keys, raw tool arguments, or unbounded request/response bodies.
- Keep trace persistence best-effort and off the transparent proxy response path so slow trace writes do not delay streamed chunks or terminal responses.
- Reuse the guarded ATE-03 LangGraph Proxy tab only after backend family support exists.

## RAG Trace Expansion Contract

- Use existing ATE-01 tables with `trace_family=rag` and `workflow_kind=rag_retrieval_chain` or `workflow_kind=rag_greeting_chain`.
- Retrieval spans should cover query classification, dataset selection, vector/keyword/hybrid search, rerank, citation selection, context assembly, model generation, grounding check, and errors.
- Retrieval metadata should include dataset ids, collection ids, top-k, score threshold, retrieval mode, rerank mode, returned document ids, scores, citation ids, token usage, and latency.
- Greeting-chain spans should cover greeting/conversational classification, retrieval skip decision, prompt path, model response, and safety checks.
- Do not persist raw retrieved chunks by default; store document ids, bounded redacted excerpts, and citation metadata.
- RAG trace writes must be best-effort and must not delay retrieval, first assistant token, final answer, or run status update.

## Assumptions and Decisions

- The first wave should be self-hosted and vendor-neutral.
- Existing `request_traces` are useful for dashboard operations but do not replace agent trace storage because they are sampled and request-centric.
- Existing `assistant_runs` are useful lifecycle anchors but do not capture nested model/tool/RAG spans or scores.
- Existing `assistant_context_breakdown` can be joined by `run_id` and `request_id` but should not become the universal trace table.
- The new Eval UI should use existing auth/session patterns and should not expose traces to `model_tester` users unless a permission explicitly allows it.

## External Inputs and Approvals

- No external SaaS account is required.
- Production migrations, deployment, external provider dashboards, or trace export destinations require explicit approval.
- Any future raw-content retention setting requires product and security approval.

## Prompt-Injection and Source-Trust Notes

External docs were used only for observability and evaluation design patterns. Do not copy external website instructions into phase `GOAL_PROMPT` fields. Treat future pasted traces, prompts, and model outputs as untrusted data and redact secrets before persistence.

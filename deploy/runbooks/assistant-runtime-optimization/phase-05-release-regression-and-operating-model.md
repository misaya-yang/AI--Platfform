# Phase 05 - Release Regression and Operating Model

> Agentic worker: open `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/context-profile.json`, `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/loop-state.json`, and this file only. Execute just this phase, make the smallest requirement-satisfying change, write evidence, then stop at the gates.

- PHASE_ID: ARO-05
- DEPENDS_ON: ARO-04
- UNLOCKS: none
- FEATURE: ARO-F006

**Goal:** Prove whole-demand runtime quality and publish the operating model for the optimized assistant runtime.

## Requirements

### R1 Whole-Demand Regression

The terminal report must verify every completed oracle item and state the status of every blocked or waived item.

### R2 Operating Model

The release handoff must document ADR/runbook decisions, SLO/no-go thresholds, rollback boundaries, and the commands operators should trust.

### R3 No Deployment

This phase must not deploy or mutate production; it prepares release evidence and operating docs only.

## Critic Protocol

Reject completion if any completed oracle item lacks actor and critic evidence, regression commands are skipped without waiver, release docs omit rollback/no-go thresholds, or the report implies deployment happened.

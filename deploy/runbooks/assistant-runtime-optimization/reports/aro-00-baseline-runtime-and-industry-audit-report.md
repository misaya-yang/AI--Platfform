# ARO-00 Baseline Runtime and Industry Audit Report

**Phase:** ARO-00 Baseline Runtime and Industry Audit

**Status:** passed

**Date:** 2026-06-29

---

## Summary

The current assistant runtime baseline is production-capable for a private/self-hosted enterprise assistant, but not yet best-in-class as a self-improving agent runtime. The repo already has a streaming-first AgentLoop, middleware chain, tool and runtime policy surfaces, DB-authoritative run/approval primitives, assistant/langgraph/rag trace families, eval APIs, and context/cache primitives. The remaining gap is closed-loop harness maturity: lifecycle middleware hooks, persisted approval resume, trace-to-eval-to-harness feedback, explicit AgentLoop checkpoint/resume, and measurable cache/context/reasoning SLIs.

ARO-00 found one concrete baseline drift while running the required assistant golden tests: the backend had added RAG retrieval stream events and AssistantConfig trace fields, but the frontend event constants and golden snapshots had not been updated, and the chat route was not passing request traceparent into AssistantConfig. This report records the small source/test scope expansion used to restore a trustworthy baseline before ARO-01.

## Plan Followed

Plan file: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/reports/aro-00-baseline-runtime-and-industry-audit-plan.md`

The plan was followed with one documented expansion: although ARO-00 was intended to edit only runbook evidence, the baseline assistant test exposed a real external contract drift. The fix stayed limited to the affected route/config wiring, frontend event constants, and golden/unit tests.

## Files Changed

- `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/reports/aro-00-baseline-runtime-and-industry-audit-plan.md`: durable ARO-00 execution plan.
- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/api/routes/chat.py`: pass request `traceparent` into `AssistantConfig` for non-streaming and streaming chat, and derive `otel_trace_id` from W3C traceparent.
- `web/src/pages/assistant/sse-events.ts`: add `rag_retrieval_started`, `rag_retrieval_completed`, and `rag_retrieval_failed` to frontend assistant stream event constants.
- `tests/services/assistant/test_agent_loop_golden.py`: update frozen stream-event and AssistantConfig field snapshots to match current intentional contracts.
- `tests/services/assistant/test_assistant_service.py`: add a route config unit test proving traceparent is preserved and `otel_trace_id` is derived.
- `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/reports/aro-00-baseline-runtime-and-industry-audit-report.md`: this actor report.
- `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/reports/aro-00-baseline-runtime-and-industry-audit-critic.md`: independent critic artifact.
- `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/feature-oracle.json`, `loop-state.json`, `progress-log.md`, `agent-handoff.md`, `continuity-ledger.md`, `source-packet.md`, and `next-window-prompt.md`: ARO-00 evidence and ARO-01 handoff state.

## Baseline Judgment

Repo evidence supports the following maturity assessment:

| Area | Evidence | Baseline Judgment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent loop | `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/agent/agent_loop.py` | Streaming-first, trace-aware, tool-capable runtime exists; still too monolithic for low-risk evolution. |
| Middleware | `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/agent/middleware.py` | `before_call`, `on_tool_call`, and `on_tool_result` exist; `on_stream_event` and `on_error` remain unwired. |
| Approval | `agent_loop.py`, `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/gateway/execution_gateway.py`, `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/api/routes/runs_approvals.py` | DB approval primitives exist; middleware CONFIRM still needs a complete persisted approval/resume/no-double-execute contract. |
| Trace/eval | `src/api/v1/eval.py`, `src/services/eval/langgraph_trace_capture.py`, `src/services/eval/rag_trace_capture.py`, trace repository tests | Assistant, LangGraph proxy, and RAG trace families exist; the missing part is failure clustering and trace-to-dataset promotion. |
| Context/cache | `core/rag/context_engine.py`, `core/quality/cache_optimizer.py` | Stable-prefix and provider cache metric parsing exist; cache/reasoning metrics are not yet release SLIs. |

## Claude Summary Reconciliation

Still accurate:

- Middleware lifecycle closure, approval completion, durable runtime, trace feedback, and cache/context optimization are the right upgrade themes.
- AgentLoop size remains a maintainability risk.
- Human approval is not complete until approval/resume semantics are persisted and idempotent.

Stale against current repo:

- LangGraph/RAG trace capture are not absent; implementation and tests already exist.
- Eval is not only basic logging; existing tests cover trace APIs, trace trees, helper payloads, and golden regression gates.
- The next step should not rebuild trace/eval foundations; it should close the loop from traces to datasets/evaluators/harness proposals.

## Validation Evidence

| Gate | Command or Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Harness structure | `python3 /Users/misaya.yanghejazfs.com.au/.codex/skills/prd-phase-harness/scripts/validate_harness_prd.py deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization --strict --quality-score` | passed | `Harness validation passed`; quality score 100. |
| Initial assistant baseline | `uv run --package assistant-service pytest -q --no-cov tests/services/assistant/test_agent_loop_golden.py tests/services/assistant/test_agent_trace_capture.py tests/services/assistant/test_agentloop_streaming_first_contract.py` | failed before fix | 31 passed, 2 golden failures: added RAG retrieval stream events and added AssistantConfig trace fields. |
| Assistant baseline after fix | Same assistant baseline command | passed | 33 passed in 0.40s. |
| Route traceparent regression | `uv run --package assistant-service pytest -q --no-cov tests/services/assistant/test_assistant_service.py::TestAssistantConfig::test_route_config_carries_traceparent` | passed | 1 passed in 0.36s. |
| Eval trace baseline | `uv run pytest -q --no-cov tests/api/test_eval_traces.py tests/api/test_eval_api_trace_tree.py tests/services/eval/test_trace_capture_helpers.py tests/services/eval/test_golden_regression_gate.py` | passed | 47 passed, 12 existing FastAPI duplicate operation-id warnings. |
| Python lint | `uv run ruff check apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/api/routes/chat.py tests/services/assistant/test_agent_loop_golden.py tests/services/assistant/test_assistant_service.py` | passed | `All checks passed!` |
| Frontend lint | `pnpm exec eslint src/pages/assistant/sse-events.ts` from `web/` | passed | No output from eslint. |
| Frontend type-check | `pnpm type-check` from `web/` | passed | `tsc --noEmit` completed successfully. |

## Minimal Change and Review

The only application code change is route-level trace correlation wiring in `chat.py`; it does not change request body schema, response shape, database schema, or model execution behavior. The frontend change only extends the existing canonical SSE event constant map. Test changes update intentional-change barriers and add one focused regression test.

Scope expansion was necessary because the baseline validation gate exposed a real contract drift. Leaving it as a blocker would have made ARO-01 inherit a failing baseline unrelated to middleware/approval work.

## Independent Critic Review

- Critic artifact: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-runtime-optimization/reports/aro-00-baseline-runtime-and-industry-audit-critic.md`
- Critic scope requested: actor report, changed files, validation evidence, ARO-F001, minimal-change boundary, and ARO-01 unlock conditions.

## Feature Oracle Updates

| Feature ID | Old Status | New Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ARO-F001 | failing | passing | This report, the ARO-00 critic artifact, and the validation evidence above. |

## Progress Log Update

`progress-log.md` now records ARO-00 as passed, the baseline drift found and fixed, the validation results, and the ARO-01 next action.

## Screenshots, Logs, or Eval Tables

No browser screenshot was required for ARO-00. Evidence is command output plus source/test diffs. The eval trace baseline produced 47 passing tests with warnings limited to existing duplicate FastAPI operation ids.

## Blockers and Deviations

No blockers remain for ARO-00. The only deviation is the documented source/test scope expansion to restore baseline contract health.

## Handoff Notes

ARO-01 may proceed. It should start from the now-passing baseline and focus on middleware lifecycle hooks plus persisted approval/resume semantics. It should not revisit baseline event/config snapshot drift except as regression protection.

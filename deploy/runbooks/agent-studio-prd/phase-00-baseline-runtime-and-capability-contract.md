# Phase 00 - Baseline Runtime and Capability Contract

> Agentic worker: open context-profile.json, loop-state.json, and this file only. Revalidate the target branch, establish the smallest safe capability seam and durable evidence, then stop.

- PHASE_ID: AS-00
- DEPENDS_ON: none
- UNLOCKS: AS-01
- FEATURE: AS-F001

**Goal:** Prove the target branch's real Assistant capability architecture and establish a tested fail-closed allowlist seam without changing user-visible Agent behavior.

## Requirements

### R1 Branch-Accurate Baseline

The report must identify the exact commit/branch relation and update every planning claim changed by the target branch.

### R2 Honest Capability Inventory

Every reachable capability family must be classified by execution source and wiring state; comments, stale routes, and configuration files are not proof of runtime reachability.

### R3 Non-Expanding Allowlist

The runtime must have a typed seam where `None` means legacy built-in behavior and an explicit set, including an empty set, is a hard upper bound before tool relevance selection and invocation.

### R4 Compatibility and Handoff

Existing Assistant isolation/API behavior must pass, and unresolved MCP/Skills/Connector defects must have an owner Phase and reproducible evidence.

## Critic Protocol

Reject if the actor assumes all tools are MCP, trusts comments over composition-root evidence, silently syncs branches, changes Agent schema/UI, weakens legacy behavior, applies the allowlist after selection, omits an empty-allowlist test, or lacks independent command evidence.

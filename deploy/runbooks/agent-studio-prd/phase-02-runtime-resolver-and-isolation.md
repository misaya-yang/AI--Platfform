# Phase 02 - Runtime Resolver and Isolation

> Agentic worker: connect immutable Agent configuration to the existing Assistant Runtime only after AS-01 contracts pass; do not add MCP/Skill/Studio channel features here.

- PHASE_ID: AS-02
- DEPENDS_ON: AS-01
- UNLOCKS: AS-03, AS-04
- FEATURE: AS-F003

**Goal:** Resolve server-authored Agent Snapshots, enforce layered prompts and non-expanding capabilities, pin sessions to Versions, and make runs/traces explicitly queryable by Agent and channel.

## Requirements

### R1 Authorized Deterministic Resolver

Only Gateway-side tenant/ACL-authorized Draft revisions or immutable Versions may become a normalized, hashed Runtime Snapshot and signed, request-bound Envelope; generic Assistant requests cannot inject Agent configuration.

### R2 Layered Prompt and Capability Boundary

Prompt trust layers and the full policy intersection must be assembled before model/tool execution; downstream selectors may only reduce capabilities.

### R3 Session and Evidence Pinning

Sessions, idempotency, checkpoints, runs and traces must bind to Agent, Version, Publication/channel and runtime fingerprints with no silent version switch.

### R4 Legacy Compatibility

When Agent Studio is disabled or a built-in Assistant request has no Agent context, the existing Assistant behavior and external SSE/API shape remain unchanged.

## Critic Protocol

Reject if clients can submit resolved capabilities, any unknown policy is fail-open, selectors/invokers disagree, prompt layers allow external data to override platform/Agent instructions, sessions hot-swap versions, key dimensions live only in free-form metadata, or existing Assistant regression evidence is absent.

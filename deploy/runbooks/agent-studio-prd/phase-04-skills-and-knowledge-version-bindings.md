# Phase 04 - Skills and Knowledge Version Bindings

> Agentic worker: make Skills and Knowledge safe, exact Agent capabilities through AS-02; do not build Studio screens or publication channels.

- PHASE_ID: AS-04
- DEPENDS_ON: AS-02
- UNLOCKS: AS-05
- FEATURE: AS-F005

**Goal:** Persist exact instruction-only Skill versions, isolate Skill catalogs, bind authorized Knowledge Datasets/configuration through normalized rows, and record traceable live-content provenance with fail-closed revocation.

## Requirements

### R1 Honest Skill Persistence and Isolation

Skill CRUD must persist or return a failure, scope all catalog/cache access by tenant/user, and never expose another tenant's same-named Skill.

### R2 Exact Skill Version Execution

Agent Versions bind `skill_version_id` and execute full immutable instruction content/manifest; tenant upload entrypoints are server-normalized, executable/bundled classes are platform-only, updates do not drift old Versions, and Skill permissions cannot expand runtime capability policy.

### R3 Authorized Knowledge Binding

Drafts and Agent Versions use normalized tenant-scoped Dataset binding rows after authorization at save/publish/run; each run records current live-content revision/provenance without claiming historical replay.

### R4 Fail-Closed Revocation and Degradation

Disabled, deleted, revoked or unavailable resources invalidate execution and produce stable, honest states without silent model-knowledge substitution.

## Critic Protocol

Reject if API success hides DB failure, registries/caches are global, Runtime reconstructs Skills from metadata only, user uploads retain arbitrary source/entrypoint or executable schemes, Skill content can authorize tools, Dataset bindings live only inside JSON, Dataset ACL is checked only at save, revision/provenance is presented as replayability without historical reads, or immutable references override later security revocation.

# Phase 05 - Agent Studio Frontend and Preview

> Agentic worker: build the Agent catalog, configuration Studio and Draft/Version Preview against passed APIs; do not implement external publication channels.

- PHASE_ID: AS-05
- DEPENDS_ON: AS-03, AS-04
- UNLOCKS: AS-06
- FEATURE: AS-F006

**Goal:** Deliver a complete, responsive and accessible Agent creation/configuration experience whose Preview reveals the exact saved Draft or immutable Version in use.

## Requirements

### R1 Complete Agent Information Architecture

`/agents`, `/agents/new` and `/agents/:agentId` must cover list, identity, instructions, model, capabilities, Knowledge, memory/safety, eval/publish entry and analytics/channel entry without replacing `/assistant`.

### R2 Truthful Conflict-Safe Editing

UI state must reflect server revisions and validation; stale edits produce a recoverable diff/conflict path and no failed save is shown as success.

### R3 Isolated Explainable Preview

Preview always names the saved Draft revision or immutable Version, starts a new session on configuration change, and displays effective capabilities/trace without revealing protected internals.

### R4 Responsive Accessible Quality

All required states work at desktop/tablet/mobile sizes with keyboard, focus, screen-reader labels, AA contrast, reduced motion and no critical/serious axe failures.

## Critic Protocol

Reject if the UI hides capability source/risk/setup, sends secrets, relies on hidden buttons for auth, silently overwrites Drafts, previews unsaved content without labeling, hot-swaps versions, omits error/permission/degraded/mobile states, introduces generic landing-page styling, or lacks browser/axe/console/network evidence.

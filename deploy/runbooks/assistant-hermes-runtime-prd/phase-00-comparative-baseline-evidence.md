# Phase 00 - Comparative Baseline Evidence

> For agentic workers: enter plan-first mode before editing. Execute this phase only, make the smallest requirement-satisfying change, write the required evidence, and do not advance to the next phase until acceptance gates pass or blockers are documented.

**Goal:** Freeze the AI--Platfform vs Hermes Agent plus OpenClaw source-backed comparison and make later implementation phases safe to execute.

**Architecture:** This phase is docs/runbook-only. It must re-check the AI--Platfform and OpenClaw paths named in `product-prd.md`, `source-packet.md`, and `openclaw-synthesis.md`, re-open the local Hermes technical report, correct stale facts, record terminology invariants, and record exact implementation boundaries before code-changing phases begin.

**Tech Stack:** AI--Platfform Assistant service, Eval services/API/UI, Makefile gates, Python/uv test commands, web pnpm commands, local Hermes technical report, and OpenClaw TypeScript/runtime docs used only as comparison evidence.

## Coding Agent Contract

- PHASE_ID: AHR-00

## Harness Runtime

- FEATURE_ORACLE: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/feature-oracle.json`
- CONTEXT_PROFILE: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/context-profile.json`
- LOOP_CONTRACT: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/loop-contract.json`
- LOOP_STATE: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/loop-state.json`
- PROGRESS_LOG: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/progress-log.md`
- AGENT_HANDOFF: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/agent-handoff.md`
- NEXT_WINDOW_PROMPT: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/next-window-prompt.md`
- CONTINUITY_LEDGER: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/continuity-ledger.md`

Session boot:

1. Read `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/context-profile.json`, `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/loop-state.json`, and this phase file only.
2. Load deferred runtime artifacts only when the context profile trigger applies.
3. Follow the loop contract: observe, select, execute, verify, record, decide.
4. Run the target phase's baseline or smoke validation before implementation when available.
5. Select one matching feature-oracle item and keep work scoped to that item and this phase.
6. Summarize inspected code facts and interface decisions back into targeted source-packet and continuity-ledger sections.
7. Record minimal-change scope and test evidence.
8. Update loop state, progress, continuity, and handoff files before exiting.
9. Hand off to an independent critic/subagent for completion review.
10. Run `--strict --completion-gate --phase AHR-00` before claiming this phase is passed or unlocked.

## Feature Oracle Policy

The feature oracle is the durable test list for long-running agents. Do not delete oracle cases to make completion easier. Update only `status`, `evidence`, and `notes` unless the user explicitly changes scope.

Status rules:

- `failing`: not implemented or not verified.
- `passing`: end-to-end actor evidence exists, cites a phase report with `Status: passed`, and cites an independent critic artifact with `Critic Verdict: approved`.
- `blocked`: a named dependency, credential, environment, or scope issue prevents completion.
- `waived`: the user explicitly waived the case and remaining risk is documented.

## Task Spec

Execute AHR-00 by using the phase contract, updating AHR-F001, and preserving the dependency chain `AHR-00 Comparative Baseline Evidence
  -> AHR-01 Entry Session And Turn Contract
  -> AHR-02 Memory Context And Compaction Lineage
  -> AHR-03 Tool Permission And Runtime Safety
  -> AHR-04 Observability Eval And Regression Cockpit
  -> AHR-05 Operating Model And Release Gate`.

## Cross-Phase Continuity

- Depends on: none
- Unlocks: AHR-01
- Feature-oracle item: AHR-F001
- Continuity ledger: `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/continuity-ledger.md`
- Prior-phase evidence to inherit: no prior phase; establish baseline evidence for dependent phases
- Boundary this phase must preserve for later phases: code/interface facts written by prior phases and any downstream contract named in the continuity ledger
- Handoff this phase must produce: phase report, progress-log entry, oracle evidence, source-packet code summary, continuity-ledger update, and agent-handoff next action

## Code Summary Writeback

Before claiming completion, inspect the code paths allowed by this phase and write back:

- `source-packet.md`: summarize discovered files, services, routes, schemas, tests, commands, and runtime constraints.
- `continuity-ledger.md`: record interface boundaries, dependency assumptions, changed contracts, and any downstream phase impact.
- `agent-handoff.md`: state the next concrete action, active feature-oracle item, validation evidence, and blocker status.
- Phase report: link validation output, independent critic evidence, minimal-change scope notes, the exact code-summary update, and completion-gate result.

## Problem Boundary

In scope:

- Work needed to satisfy AHR-F001 for Comparative Baseline Evidence.
- Code inspection and summary writeback required to keep later phases aligned.

Out of scope:

- Production deployment.
- Production data mutation.
- Unrelated feature work outside this phase chain.

## Context Policy

Before editing, inspect:

- Start with `context-profile.json`, `loop-state.json`, and this phase file.
- Inspect the repository and re-open the local Hermes technical report to establish baseline facts before unlocking implementation phases.
- Open `source-packet.md` and `continuity-ledger.md` only for targeted writeback after inspection.

Do not load unrelated files unless a blocker requires expanding context.
Do not load full runtime artifacts when `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/context-profile.json` provides a narrower trigger or slice.

## Requirements

### R1 Source-Backed Comparison

AHR-00 must prove or correct the comparison claims in `product-prd.md` with local file evidence or report citation. Any assertion about AI--Platfform gaps must cite an AI path or be marked `verify-needed` rather than stated as fact. Any Hermes line-level claim must be marked unavailable unless a Hermes source checkout is located and inspected.

### R2 Implementation Boundary Freeze

AHR-00 must name the concrete AI--Platfform surfaces each later phase may touch, plus protected non-goals. Do not unlock AHR-01 until this boundary is written into `source-packet.md`, `continuity-ledger.md`, and the AHR-00 report.

### R3 Validation Command Map

AHR-00 must record the exact docs, backend, eval, assistant-service, and web commands that later phases should use. If a command cannot run locally, record the command and what a pass should look like.

## Test and Regression Requirements

Run the docs validation command for this PRD and record the exact output:

```bash
python3 /Users/misaya.yanghejazfs.com.au/.codex/skills/prd-phase-harness/scripts/validate_harness_prd.py deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd --strict --quality-score
```

Do not claim backend or frontend tests passed unless they are actually run during AHR-00.

## Compliance and Safety Requirements

Do not expose secrets, mutate production data, deploy, or use external services unless the required approval and source packet entry exist.

## Rollback and Recovery

Revert phase-scoped code changes, restore runtime docs from git, and mark the oracle item blocked if validation cannot be recovered.

## Execution Capture

Write the phase report, append progress-log evidence, update oracle evidence, update continuity-ledger boundaries, and refresh agent-handoff next action.

Use ``deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/reports/phase-report-template.md`` when writing the phase report.

## Critic Protocol

Reject completion if evidence is missing, tests or critic review are absent, code facts were not written back, continuity boundaries are stale, scope expansion lacks justification, or the phase tries to unlock dependent work without a report.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AHR-F001 has evidence or a documented blocker.
- `deploy/runbooks/assistant-hermes-runtime-prd/reports/ahr-00-comparative-baseline-evidence-report.md` exists or is named as blocked evidence.
- `source-packet.md`, `continuity-ledger.md`, `progress-log.md`, and `agent-handoff.md` reflect the latest code facts and next action.
- Minimal-change scope, test evidence, and independent critic verdict are recorded.

## Risks

- Phase isolation can break if downstream boundary changes are not recorded.
- Implementation can drift if code summaries stay stale.
- Long-running agents can repeat work if handoff evidence is incomplete.

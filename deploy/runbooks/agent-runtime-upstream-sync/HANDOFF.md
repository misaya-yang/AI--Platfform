# Handoff

- Active phase: ARU-04
- Active feature: ARU-F005
- Status: working
- Completed: `candidate_complete` — synced upstream `94cbbddafc`, preserved the platform overlay, built Runtime/Worker only through Docker, repaired review and live-test findings, and completed authenticated in-app-browser acceptance for Assistant, approvals, history, Agent Studio, and Eval.
- Evidence: Runtime/Worker `local-94cbbddafc17-46158add036c`; 9 services healthy; Runtime/Worker Docker suites, 148-test Agent configuration/Eval matrix, offline release gate, 44-test CLI gate, native package preview, 121-test web suite, live Responses 2/2, live platform convergence 3/3, IAB Qwen/tool/history/Agent Preview/Eval Trace, candidate rollback, and final source/LOC/harness gates passed.
- Next action: Commit the final repairs, refresh `origin/main`, fast-forward `main` to this branch if topology remains clean, run the final post-merge status check, and push normally.
- Blockers: The official full release-unit rollback is blocked before mutation because the exact immutable frozen Runtime image is absent and four other frozen artifacts are absent or digest-mismatched. A candidate-only Runtime/Worker rollback passed but does not satisfy the frozen-bundle contract.
- Confirmation: Answered — browser credential entry, merge to `main`, commit, and normal push are authorized.
- Decision: continue

Keep this as the latest checkpoint. Use Git history for older handoffs.

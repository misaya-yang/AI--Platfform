# Working Agreement

> How work moves through this repository, for humans and for agents on any device.

**Schema:** `harness/workflow/v2`

---

## 1. Cold start

Any agent picking up this repo, on any machine, boots in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md` — contract, repo map, canonical commands.
2. `docs/harness/README.md` — this harness.
3. `docs/README.md` — documentation index; find the doc that owns your area.
4. If the task belongs to a running program: that program's `loop-state.json` and active phase file.
5. For architecture or repository-wide work: [`work-packages.md`](work-packages.md) and the active
   package receipt.

Everything an agent needs must be reachable from those entry files. **If knowledge is not in the
repository, it does not exist.** Do not rely on chat history, a previous session's context, an
external directory, or a teammate's machine.

## 2. The task loop

Every unit of work runs `observe → act → verify → decide`.

| Stage | Meaning | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| observe | Read the code and the doc that owns the area. Reproduce the current behaviour. | A one-line statement of what is actually true now |
| act | Make the smallest change that satisfies the task. | A diff |
| verify | Run the gate from `docs/harness/commands.md` §7 that matches what you touched. | Command + real output |
| decide | Done, blocked, or needs a follow-up task. | An explicit verdict |

Never merge `act` and `verify` into a claim. A change is unverified until a gate has run.

## 3. Definition of done

A task is done when **all** hold:

- The change is scoped to the request — no drive-by refactors, renames, or reformatting.
- Public contracts (`docs/harness/architecture.md` §6) are unchanged, or changed deliberately with
  their gate re-run and `CHANGELOG.md` updated.
- The matching gate ran and passed, and you can quote the command and result.
- Anything not verified is stated explicitly.
- The doc that owns the area is updated in the same change, not "later".
- The result receipt identifies the tested base/head SHA and distinguishes passed, failed, blocked,
  and skipped checks.

## 4. Programs and large changes

Work that crosses several contracts or may outlive one context window becomes a **program** under
`deploy/runbooks/<program-name>/`. Its `loop-state.json` is the only execution-status authority.
The file contract is determined by the state's declared schema. The current harness structurally
inspects known schemas but treats several semantic/file issues as warnings; strict lifecycle,
package and evidence validation is queued in ARC-00. This document does not maintain a competing
hard-coded list.

A program must record lifecycle, base SHA, active package, blockers, last update, evidence receipts,
and its successor when superseded. Terminal or superseded programs may not retain an executable
`next_action`, `active_phase`, or `active_feature`. Their nested phase records remain immutable
historical snapshots even if they still say `ready/pending`; top-level lifecycle makes them
non-executable and a successor program must create new package state.

One large product outcome still has one primary implementation session and one writer worktree.
The session may execute sequential packages and survive context compaction through the program
ledger. Parallel agents are read-only explorers or reviewers unless the user explicitly creates a
different independent product outcome. See [`work-packages.md`](work-packages.md).

Rules:

- One package at a time runs `observe → freeze → act → verify → review → integrate → decide`.
- `passes: true` requires a named command, real output, tested SHA and permitted skip count.
- Status lives in `loop-state.json`, never only in prose or `docs/README.md`.
- A program is complete only when every required package is verified, blockers are empty, the
  integrated candidate passed its live gates, and rollback evidence matches the full release unit.

## 5. Worktrees and shared resources

- Two writers never share a worktree.
- A product-scale architecture change uses one owning worktree; packages are review boundaries,
  not concurrent branches.
- Docker, Rust builds, migrations, local browser state and provider quota are machine-global
  resources. They are serialized under the integration owner.
- A worktree that does not own the running Compose project may inspect but may not mutate it.
- Shared integration paths listed in [`work-packages.md`](work-packages.md) are changed only after
  their implementation packages are stable.
- Read [`integration-and-rollback.md`](integration-and-rollback.md) for the verification ladder,
  low-memory rules and release receipts.

## 6. Encoding feedback

The harness improves by absorbing corrections. When a review comment, a bug, or a user correction
would apply to the *next* task too, encode it instead of just fixing the instance:

| Kind of correction | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| "The agent keeps doing X wrong" | A rule in `AGENTS.md` (only if load-bearing) or the owning harness doc |
| A boundary that must not be crossed | `docs/harness/architecture.md` + a test that fails when crossed |
| A command people keep getting wrong | `docs/harness/commands.md` + a Make target |
| A recurring class of defect | A gate in the Makefile, wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

Prefer a mechanical check over a written rule. A rule nobody enforces decays; a gate does not.

## 7. Git

- Do not commit or push unless the user asks.
- Branch off `main`; never commit directly to `main` for feature work.
- Conventional commit subjects, matching existing history: `feat(assistant): …`, `fix(api): …`,
  `refactor: …`, `docs: …`, `ci: …`, `gate: …`.
- One logical change per commit. Keep PRs short-lived — a follow-up correction beats a week-long review.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` states what a PR must show; verification evidence is not optional.

## 8. Repository quality

Dead code, stale docs, and drifted comments are tracked, not tolerated:

- The 2026-08-13 hygiene scan is historical input, not a current count. Rebuild the baseline after
  major merges.
- Before deleting anything, prove static and dynamic non-use, check entrypoints/contracts, and run
  direct gates before and after the deletion.
- Dead production code is deleted rather than moved into an `old/` directory; accepted ADRs,
  migrations and evidence are preserved or explicitly superseded.
- Empty/self-proving tests, false-green gates, stale active docs, unowned dependencies, oversized
  no-growth files, and ignored “durable” screenshots are quality defects.
- Follow [`repository-quality.md`](repository-quality.md) for classification, evidence retention,
  screenshot policy and deletion receipts.

# AI Gateway Assistant × KB session handoff

Updated: 2026-08-08 (America/New_York)

## Read first

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and follow its repository, Docker, secret, verification, and Git rules.
2. Read this file before opening the implementation. Do not repeat the completed UAO work unless new evidence shows a regression.
3. The authoritative completed Harness is outside the repository at
   `/Users/yang/study_data/general-assistant-optimization-harness-2026-07-18`.
   Its `README.md`, `loop-state.json`, `HANDOFF.md`, `init.sh`, and active phase
   are the continuity contract for the completed optimization program.

## Current state

- Repository: `/Users/yang/projects/AI--Platfform`
- Branch: `main`
- Baseline commit: `5703e5c5e7ecf1fdf40e3bdd116e73e653cf1250`
- Remote state before creating this handoff: `HEAD == origin/main`; the working
  tree was clean.
- Product posture: General AI Assistant plus KB, not a coding-agent product.
- Harness state: UAO-00 through UAO-14 are `done`; all 15 declared features
  (sparse IDs from UAO-F001 through UAO-F028) pass; `Blockers: none`;
  `Decision: done`.
- This handoff and its README link are intentionally local, uncommitted changes.
  Re-check `git status --short --branch` before any edit or staging action.

## Completed work

The current baseline implements the Assistant × KB capability and reliability
plan without changing the required public Assistant, Responses, SSE, approval,
artifact, trace, or KB contracts. The main delivered areas are:

- result-level live Assistant and Assistant × KB capability tests;
- controlled pre-delta model failover with explicit server-side mappings;
- strict tool argument schema validation and one correction opportunity;
- optional, redacted large tool-output spill into existing artifact storage;
- staged, anti-thrashing context compaction and external-content trust envelopes;
- explicit MCP operation metadata with unknown tools treated as potential writes;
- tenant-scoped provider/model resolution for Assistant and KB;
- a compact, non-conflicting General Assistant system prompt hierarchy;
- Agent Plugins 1.0.0 support in skills-only mode, with no bundled script or
  `mcp.json` execution;
- quickstart, Docker distribution, frontend, security, isolation, and rollback
  coverage.

Important implementation entry points:

- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/agent/agent_loop.py`
- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/prompts/system_prompt_v2.py`
- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/models/model_failover.py`
- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/agent/middlewares/tool_output_spill.py`
- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/runtime/context/external_content.py`
- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/tool_invoker.py`
- `apps/assistant-service/src/assistant_service/core/mcp/`
- `apps/knowledge-service/src/knowledge_service/services/knowledge/`
- `packages/ai-gateway-core/src/ai_gateway_core/agent_plugins.py`
- `src/services/eval/assistant_capability.py`
- `tests/integration/test_assistant_api_e2e_live.py`
- `tests/integration/test_assistant_kb_capability_live.py`

## Feature switches and promotion posture

These optional capabilities remain off by default in `.env.example` and
`docker-compose.yml`:

- `ASSISTANT_RUNTIME_FAILOVER_V2=false`
- `ASSISTANT_TOOL_OUTPUT_SPILL_ENABLED=false`
- `ASSISTANT_STAGED_COMPACTION_ENABLED=false`
- `ASSISTANT_RUNTIME_SKILLS=false`
- `ASSISTANT_SUBAGENTS_ENABLED=false`

`ASSISTANT_MODEL_FALLBACKS_JSON={}` is an explicit server-side mapping, not a
model-supplied policy. Do not enable Skills, subagents, or retrieval variants by
default until result-level evaluation demonstrates benefit without permission,
cancellation, isolation, cost, or answer-quality regressions.

## Verification evidence

Freshly checked while preparing this handoff:

- `python3 /Users/yang/.codex/skills/prd-phase-harness/scripts/validate_harness_prd.py /Users/yang/study_data/general-assistant-optimization-harness-2026-07-18 --strict --claim-check`
  passed. This validates Harness structure and claim metadata; it does not rerun
  the cited tests.
- Eight `ai-gateway-*` containers were healthy, and every running container's
  `com.docker.compose.project.working_dir` was
  `/Users/yang/projects/AI--Platfform`.

Accepted evidence recorded in the Harness, not rerun for this handoff edit:

- `make verify-assistant-runtime-dev`: 5/5 groups passed.
- `make eval-e1-gate`: 200 tests passed; Assistant golden 25/25; stateful 7/7;
  recorded RAG recall/MRR/nDCG were 1.0.
- `make test-isolation`: 6/6 passed.
- Focused prompt/context/docgen/subagent suite: 201 passed.
- Real `qwen3.7-plus` Assistant capability: 3/3 result-level trials passed.
- Real Assistant × KB lifecycle: 3/3 trials passed, including grounding,
  follow-up, cross-user denial, and deletion.
- Native Chromium live suite: 24 passed and one conditional Playground skip.
- Frontend lint: 0 errors; type-check and production build passed.
- Promotion/rollback focused suite: 55 passed.
- Security diff scan `b560af4b-fc17-41c4-b7a3-55c7dfba7323`: 72/72 source/config
  receipts, 10/10 reviewed security surfaces, 0 findings, 0 deferred.

Before making new completion claims, rerun checks proportional to the changed
surface. The stable offline gates are:

```bash
make verify-assistant-runtime-dev
make eval-e1-gate
make test-isolation
corepack pnpm@10.33.0 -C web lint
corepack pnpm@10.33.0 -C web type-check
corepack pnpm@10.33.0 -C web build
```

For Docker or live testing, inspect ownership and health first. Keep the
low-memory setting and do not rebuild images for source-only changes:

```bash
export COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=1
docker ps
docker compose ps
make status
```

Never print provider keys or generated `.env` values. Real-provider tests use
the configured environment and the default `qwen3.7-plus`; disable failover for
a primary-model baseline.

## Known issues / current breakage

### 2026-08-09 local migration addendum

- The explicitly authorized local per-service migration applied all six current
  SQL files and an immediate rerun skipped all six as already applied.
- Compose now gives Gateway, Assistant, and Knowledge service-owned search
  paths. The migrated local environment sets `GATEWAY_DATABASE_AUTO_INIT=false`
  so Gateway cannot recreate shadow Assistant/Knowledge tables.
- The legacy runner now anchors its ledger in `public.schema_migrations` and
  recognizes schema-split base tables instead of reapplying `schema.sql`.
- The migrated local PostgreSQL run completed the formerly skipped memory test:
  full Assistant result `1943 passed, 0 skipped`. Post-migration real
  `qwen3.7-plus` E2E passed in `188.73s`.
- This is local evidence only; no production migration, deployment, commit, or
  push was performed.

- No reproducible P0/P1 code breakage is known at this checkpoint.
- Node 24 produces an engine warning because the repository declares Node 22;
  the recorded frontend type-check and production build still passed. Use Node
  22 for release reproduction.
- The Codex in-app browser and Chrome extension returned
  `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` before loading local HTTP. The repository-native
  Chromium Playwright suite supplied the browser evidence instead.

## Unverified and out of scope

- The external answer-quality judge was not run; recorded RAG metrics are not a
  substitute for that judge.
- Published multi-architecture release images were not recertified against this
  exact commit after the final source changes.
- Production, external dashboards, production migration, production canary,
  deployment, and rollback execution were not performed.
- No deployment or destructive operation is authorized by this handoff.

## Recommended continuation

The UAO implementation itself is complete. A new session should not invent more
runtime abstraction or reopen every phase. Start by confirming the user's next
scope. If the intent is to close the remaining release-evidence gaps, use this
order:

1. Re-check Git status, Harness strict validation, Compose ownership, service
   readiness, and usable Qwen configuration without revealing secrets.
2. Run the external answer-quality judge in a temporary report directory and
   keep it separate from offline fixtures and real-provider capability receipts.
3. Recertify the published `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` image references
   against the open-source quickstart contract; do not rebuild or overwrite the
   published tags silently.
4. Only with explicit user authorization, prepare a production canary and
   rollback exercise. Deployment, migration, image publication, commit, push,
   force operations, and cleanup remain separate authority boundaries.

If the next task is a product feature instead, preserve the current contracts
and use the smallest change plus focused result-level tests. Do not count
"non-empty output" as Assistant or KB capability success.

## Ready-to-paste prompt for the next session

```text
继续 /Users/yang/projects/AI--Platfform 的 Assistant × KB 工作。先完整读取 AGENTS.md、根目录 HANDOFF.md，以及 /Users/yang/study_data/general-assistant-optimization-harness-2026-07-18 的 README.md、loop-state.json、HANDOFF.md、init.sh 和当前 phase。当前 main 基线为 5703e5c5e7ecf1fdf40e3bdd116e73e653cf1250，UAO-00 至 UAO-14 已完成且 strict claim-check 已通过，不要重复重构或把 coding-agent 架构强加给 General Assistant。先核对 git 状态、Docker Compose working_dir、服务健康和证据层级，再按我接下来给出的具体目标做最小修改和结果级验证。不得打印密钥；未明确授权不得 commit、push、deploy、迁移、清理容器/卷或执行其他不可逆操作。
```

## Decision

Handoff ready. The completed UAO baseline is usable; the next session must
receive or confirm a new concrete scope before modifying it.

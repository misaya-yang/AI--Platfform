"""Run/approval queries and the Runtime control-plane accessor for entry routes.

Moved from ``src/api/v1/assistant.py`` by ARC-01.  The ``assistant_runs`` and
``assistant_tool_approvals`` tables remain the run-state authority (ADR-004);
these helpers only read them so route modules do not carry raw SQL or import

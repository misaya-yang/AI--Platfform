"""Stable facade for the ``/api/v1/assistant`` surface (ARC-01).

The route handlers live in ``src/api/v1/_assistant_routes`` split by use case
(catalog / runs / chat / sessions / artifacts / metrics) and the shared
entry-side services live in ``src/services/assistant_entry``.  This module
only builds the public router and keeps time-limited compatibility
re-exports; it must not grow handler logic again.

Contract baseline: ``tmp/assistant-api-routes-before.json`` — the split is
verified zero-drift for paths, methods, operation ids and status codes, with
the single sanctioned exception of 500-error detail sanitization (ARC-01
deliverable 6).

# Time-limited compatibility surface (ARC-01).
#
# Everything below the router construction is a re-export kept for
# pre-ARC-01 import paths.  Removal condition: delete after ARC-08 once an
# import-scan gate (`rg "from src.api.v1.assistant import"` /
# `from .assistant import` across src/, tests/, scripts/, apps/, sdk/)
# shows zero hits for these names.  Do not add new consumers — import from
# the real home listed per group above.
#
# Known consumers at split time:
#   - router: src/api/router.py (permanent, not compat)
#   - _start_agent_runtime_turn: no Python import consumers, but the textual
#     single-kernel gate (scripts/harness/agent_runtime_single_kernel_gate.py)
#     asserts this name exists in this file's source
#   - prepare_run_resume: tests/api/test_gateway_capability_matrix.py
#   - get_artifact_storage: former monkeypatch seam of
#     tests/api/test_assistant_sessions.py (migrated to patch
#     src.api.v1._assistant_routes.artifacts directly)
#   - underscore helper aliases: src/api/v1/agent_runtime.py and
#     src/api/v1/responses.py were migrated in the same change; no remaining
#     consumers are known.

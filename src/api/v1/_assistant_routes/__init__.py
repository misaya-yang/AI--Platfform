"""Route modules for the ``/api/v1/assistant`` surface (ARC-01 split).

``src/api/v1/assistant.py`` is the stable facade: it builds the router from
these sub-modules and keeps time-limited compatibility re-exports.  Route
modules must not import each other as libraries — shared helpers live in
``src/services/assistant_entry``.

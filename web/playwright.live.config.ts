/**
 * Regression config for running Playwright against the ALREADY-RUNNING Docker
 * stack (frontend :8081, gateway :8080, knowledge :8092).
 *
 * It reuses the base project/auth setup but drops the `webServer` block so
 * Playwright does NOT try to spawn the dev stack (which would clash with the
 * live containers, e.g. postgres already bound to :5432). The live stack is
 * expected to be healthy before invoking:
 *
 *   E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081 E2E_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
 *     npx playwright test -c playwright.live.config.ts --workers=1
